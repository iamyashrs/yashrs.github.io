Hello there.

It has been time, since i have made an attempt to update my blog with the ongoing’s of my life. But now would be the right time probably.

Alot have changed in some months, like i am now a 4th Year Final student at Jaypee University of Engineering and Technology(JUET), Guna. That’s pretty bad-ass bro.

And as every engineer need to complete a mandatory training/internship at the end of the 3rd Year of B.Tech i also did.

In 2015, i attended [GopherConIndia](http://www.gophercon.in/) conference, Bangalore where i met alot of techies & awesome people. Where there was this one startup, that at that time were working on a exciting new technology which involved both hardware and software mashup on their new product called ‘Twist’, and immediately it was clear to me that i wanted to experience this work.

So i got an internship for 6 weeks at [RainingClouds](http://rainingclouds.com/)/[BetaCraft](http://betacraft.co/)
Pune from June to July of 2015.

This here, is the screen shot of our first successful Multi touch driver test painting with 3 points on the screen. That was a memorable day.

Pune
----

Well, I just loved pune. It was so refreshing, people are so nice, young people all around. I would argue that pune is probably the best city to live in india right now, if you are 20+, love life and need work.

With so much to offer pune stands out from other biggies of India like New Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai etc. and the food is so versatile that even a month in pune you would be eating new stuff each day & the tastes are muah.

Some pictures.
